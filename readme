This is just for project purposes. Don't take it seriously :)

In this activity, you will be learning the basics of GIT. The project uses the same files that were used
in activity 1, i.e., basically a factorial calculating program, which says “hello” before reporting the
factorial value.
The project source files are in a repository directory “group_N” on the online Git server
(https://github.com/cs308lap/group_N).
